# ALS-Keyboard-with-Neural-Networks
Keyboard for people with ALS that is more robust, cheaper, and lower maintenance than the current robotic approach.

This project was competed at a hackathon and we won first place. We are planning to complete this project this summer (2017) with proper style as it lacks all style right now.
